    <p>
      Still need to finish the last two blog posts, but wanted to get a placeholder here for the new window manager
      I have been using with a terminal tool called tmux.

    <h3>Vim Or Bust - March 31, 2022</h3>
    <p>
      According to Google, Vim (text editor) was first released in November of 1991. A 30 year old text editor!
      You may ask yourself, why on earth are you writing about this?! Great question! I actually hated Vim when 
      I first became an engineer. I thought, why the hell would you use this?! Also, how the hell do you write to
      a file?!?!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorry, got taken away there for a second. Anyway ... I finally did figure out how to write to a file and
      so so much more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Vim at the beginning is a bit cumbersome and clunky. It takes a lot of practice to get good, but once
      you figure it out and get that muscle memory down, it can totally be a GameChanger.

    <h3>Java Jdbc Template and PostgreSQL - February 25, 2022</h3>
    <p>
      Lots to discuss since my last post. I have added a new repository into the Dough Management API that
      will be in charge of all things Postgres. The PostgresBlogRepository is currently implementing an
      interface with two functions on it (findBlog and saveBlog) ...

    <h3>Organizing Scripts in Vue - February 21, 2022</h3>
    <p>
      Good morning, Dev world. Recently, I have been thinking about how to organize my Vue.js scripts within my dough-dev
      project. I started playing around with Vue 3 and liked it, but it felt more like a Angular application where you
      create components and organize everything like an application instead of a HTML page.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that being said, I have made the decision to stick with Vue 2 and keep this blog very simple and not turn it into
      an application until necessary.

    <h3>API Calls using Vue.js - February 16, 2022</h3>
    <p>It worked! {{ info }}</p>
    <p>
      The above "{{ info }}" text is coming back from a GET request that I set up on a new api using axios.
      I have never used axios before prior to playing around with Vue.js, but so far it has been very easy to implement.
      The GET request is being mounted onto Vue data() using axios and receiving the response using a promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also decided to spin up a new postgres db that will be used to store these blog posts using the new management api
      that I created to post and get data for Dough Dev Details. Next steps will be to create some test data that I will query
      through the DoughDevService and return to the blog. After that has been completed, I will implement that "Create" button using
      Vue to pop a modal and send a POST request to that api to save into postgres.

    <h3>Algorithms - February 14, 2022</h3>
    <p>
      Second post of the day alert! Today was a good day of balance and productivity. Time with family, time at work,
      time to code, time to workout, time for Valentine's Day dinner from our favorite Chinese restaurant, and
      additional
      time to code and watch Netflix with the Project Manager
      (this is my nickname for my wife, she keeps me on track most of the time &#128514;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Tonight, I have been working on a quicksort algorithm written in Java. I do this occasionally when I want to dust
      off
      a language that I plan on using in the future or when I want to focus my mind on solving problems step by step in
      small
      chunks. In tonight's code both cases were true.

    <h3>Back at it! - February 14, 2022</h3>
    <p>
      Greetings, Dough Dev world! I am back at it again with new updates and a new year to try and keep some consistency
      going with side dev projects. I think it is probably too lofty a goal to try and commit once a day for 100 days or
      whatever
      that Insta challenge is that bootcampers do these days, but I do think at least 2-3 posts a week could be very
      doable and see how that will grow or change over time.

    <h3>The Plan - September 19, 2021</h3>
    <p>
      I have been thinking about what to do with this blog for quite some time now, and I've decided my main
      objective will be to document my development goals, struggles, and accomplishments for the forseeable future.
      FYI - I have not installed a spellcheck for vscode yet, so apologies for any typo errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my first little project (you could refer to it as a story if you are an Agile fan) I am going to be
      implementing
      a "Post" button using Vue.js to pop a modal, allow a user (me for now) to type an entry, then save it to a
      postgresql
      database through a NodeJS api that I built. A follow up story will then be to select the blog entry from the db
      and
      display it on a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I am doing these stories/projects, I will also be playing around with the design of this site (trying to master
      mobile first design). I think it will be cool to start very vanilla using little css to launch this blog and watch
      it change over time.

    <h3>Blog Resurrection - September 18, 2021</h3>
    <p>
      Bringing my blog back to life to document what is going on in my dev life, as I work full time as a Software
      Engineer for a popular Sporting Goods retailer in the United States; as well as, experiment/research new tech
      at night or on my weekends. Currently, playing around with Vue.js as I build out the Dev Details page to compare
      a lighter weight library compared to Angular (my choice for building out web apps).

    <h3>Schedule: Makers VS Managers - April 7, 2018</h3>
    <p>
      The art of a person's schedule. The well known calendar invite. Some (let's refer to this group as
      "Managers")
      live by this tool
      and cannot function properly without checking it every morning to plan the upcoming day. However, for others
      (let's refer to these
      people as "Makers") see this tool as more of a creative killer, a buzzkill, a wet blanket (I think you get
      my
      point) that just becomes
      a part of life that you learn to live with because society deems it "normal".
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up in a very "Always show up 5 minutes early" type environment, it was definitely instilled in me at
      a
      very young age that
      it is rude to show up late for an appointment/meeting/commitment. Humans as a whole, respect the value of
      time
      and do our best to manage it,
      control it, and try to optimize it throughout our lives. The issue that I have run into with this type of
      mindset is that creation/creativity
      does not live on a timed schedule. Now, of course there are ways to set aside time for creative thoughts and
      process; however, when you get "real"
      with yourself, sometimes creativity just strikes during your morning shower, or in the middle of a meeting,
      or
      maybe right before you fall asleep. My initial
      instinct when this little beam of brilliance hits me is to write it down, sketch it up, or code that motha
      until
      the cows come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, herein lies the issue ... I cannot just get up and leave a meeting to go indulge on a little
      creative snack. I
      find if my entire day is following a
      "Managers" schedule that very little creative work gets done that day. Usually what occurs is a lot of
      planning,
      and discussing, and perhaps some problem
      generation gets done, but usually very little out of the box thinking occurs. On the flip side, if I block
      out
      maybe the first four hours of my morning,
      just to hold from being scooped up by the meeting troll ... then more times than not, something cool and new
      is
      generated or brought into existence to play a role (maybe)
      in this wonderful world called Design.
