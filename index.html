    <h5>Schedule: Makers VS Managers - April 7, 2018</h5>
    <p>
      The art of a person's schedule. The well known calendar invite. Some (let's refer to this group as
      "Managers")
      live by this tool
      and cannot function properly without checking it every morning to plan the upcoming day. However, for others
      (let's refer to these
      people as "Makers") see this tool as more of a creative killer, a buzzkill, a wet blanket (I think you get
      my
      point) that just becomes
      a part of life that you learn to live with because society deems it "normal".
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up in a very "Always show up 5 minutes early" type environment, it was definitely instilled in me at
      a
      very young age that
      it is rude to show up late for an appointment/meeting/commitment. Humans as a whole, respect the value of
      time
      and do our best to manage it,
      control it, and try to optimize it throughout our lives. The issue that I have run into with this type of
      mindset is that creation/creativity
      does not live on a timed schedule. Now, of course there are ways to set aside time for creative thoughts and
      process; however, when you get "real"
      with yourself, sometimes creativity just strikes during your morning shower, or in the middle of a meeting,
      or
      maybe right before you fall asleep. My inital
      instinct when this little beam of brilliance hits me is to write it down, sketch it up, or code that motha
      until
      the cows come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, herein lies the issue ... I cannot just get up and leave a meeting to go indulge on a little
      creative snack. I
      find if my entire day is following a
      "Managers" schedule that very little creative work gets done that day. Usually what occurs is a lot of
      planning,
      and discussing, and perhaps some problem
      generation gets done, but usually very little out of the box thinking occurs. On the flip side, if I block
      out
      maybe the first four hours of my morning,
      just to hold from being scooped up by the meeting troll ... then more times than not, something cool and new
      is
      generated or brought into existence to play a role (maybe)
      in this wonderful world called Design.
